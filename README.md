## Features
**fonterator**'s current features:
* Load TTF fonts and font collections.
* Load some OTF fonts and font collections.
* Automatic kerning and font layout.
* Horizontal and vertical text layout.
* Left-to-right and right-to-left text layout.

**fonterator**'s planned features:
* Support OpenType formatted fonts that are not just TrueType fonts (OpenType is
a superset of TrueType). Notably there is no support yet for cubic Bezier curves
used in glyphs.
* Support ligatures of any kind (â€½, etc.).
* Support some less common TrueType sub-formats.
